# Instructions to effectively use google takeout

Pre-requisites:
- If you have multiple google accounts you use frequently (> 1 per month) then follow this procedure for all your google accounts.
- If you do not have a google account, please create one.
- If you have multiple phones, please make sure you follow this procedure for each phone.


Start of study period (wave 1):
1. Turn on sync in Chrome: [link to blog post explaining how](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-manage-cross-device-syncing-in-chrome/).
2. Turn off in-app browsing:
  - In Android: [Facebook how to](https://lifehacker.com/disable-facebooks-in-app-browser-to-use-your-preferred-1658842307), [Facebook how to2](https://www.technologyhint.com/disable-facebook-in-app-browser/), and [Twitter how to](https://www.technologyhint.com/disable-twitter-in-app-browser/).
  - iOS: It is possible to [sync all your browsing histories](https://www.igeeksblog.com/how-to-sync-safari-icloud-history-from-mac/) of different Apple devices and can [access the browsing history](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4927279) on your computer. You have one SQL database that includes your browsing history for all devices you used.
  - To do 1: Clarify whether iOS users have to upload this file.
  - To do 2: Check whether iOS devices are synced by default.
3. Turn on Web&App activity in chrome [here](https://myaccount.google.com/activitycontrols?pli=1).
4. Turn off automatic deletion of browser history after X weeks/days.

To do: It would be good to have a quick check that it all works. In this early phase the experiment itself is the check, but in the real study/survey it may be good to think about intermediate checkpoints (if possible).
