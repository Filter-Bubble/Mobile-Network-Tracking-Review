# Instructions to effectively use Google Takeout

### Pre-requisites:
* If you have multiple google accounts you use frequently (> 1 per month) then follow this procedure for all your google accounts.
* If you do not have a google account, please create one.
* If you have multiple phones, please make sure you follow this procedure for each phone.

### Start of study period (wave 1):

1. Go to [Google MyActivity](https://myaccount.google.com/activitycontrols) and verify that "Web & App Activity" is enabled
2. Use Chrome as the default browser for both Desktop and Mobile
3. Log into your Google Account on both mobile and desktop
4. Turn on sync in Chrome: [link to blog post explaining how](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-manage-cross-device-syncing-in-chrome/).
5. Turn off in-app browsing:
   * In Android: [Facebook how to](https://lifehacker.com/disable-facebooks-in-app-browser-to-use-your-preferred-1658842307), [Facebook how to2](https://www.technologyhint.com/disable-facebook-in-app-browser/), and [Twitter how to](https://www.technologyhint.com/disable-twitter-in-app-browser/).
   * iOS: It is possible to [sync all your browsing histories](https://www.igeeksblog.com/how-to-sync-safari-icloud-history-from-mac/) of different Apple devices and can [access the browsing history](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4927279) on your computer. You have one SQL database that includes your browsing history for all devices you used.
   * To do 1: Clarify whether iOS users have to upload this file.
   * To do 2: Check whether iOS devices are synced by default.
6. Turn off automatic deletion of browser history after X weeks/days.

### Intermediate check?
To do: It would be good to have a quick check that it all works. In this early phase the experiment itself is the check, but in the real study/survey it may be good to think about ways to check that data collection is going as planned.

### End of study period (wave 2):

1. Go to [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/)
2. Click "Select None"
3. Select "Chrome"
4. Click "Next" (scroll down)
5. Verify the settings are:
   * File type: Zip files
   * Archive size (max): 50GB
   * Delivery method: Send download link via email
6. Click "Create Archive"
7. Wait until archive is created (may take hours)
8. Go to [Google Takeout Archives](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout/downloads)
9. Download latest archive zip


### Suggestions for evaluating the data collection yourself:

1. Before doing the take out, use your mobile phone to go to a website where you would otherwise never go to, make sure you never visit this website with your desktop browser. For example, this website from the Dutch embassy in Moscow. https://www.nederlandwereldwijd.nl/landen/rusland/over-ons/ambassade-moskou.
2. Before doing the take out, e-mail yourself the following url without opening it: https://www.netherlandsworldwide.nl/countries/oman/about-us/embassy-of-the-kingdom-of-the-netherlands-in-muscat. Next, open the e-mail sent to yourself in your mobile phone and click on the link.
3. Before doing the take out, make sure you collect data for at least a couple of weeks. 

After doing the takeout, and unzipping the zip-file:
- Can check whether this websites from 1. and 2, are captured by google take out?
- Does google take out store your browsing behavior for the entire study period as expected?
- Does the google take out collect any information you did not expect?
